# TinyKVM in Drogon

This is an example repository that embeds TinyKVM in Drogon. TinyKVM provides safe sandboxing for tenants/programs.

We can reach 1.8M req/s with native performance KVM-based VMs handling requests with ~19us latency.

Unmodified [Deno straight from website](https://deno.com/) runs "hello world" JavaScript at 260k req/s with ~61us latency. This is with per-request isolation, where VMs get reset after every request.
